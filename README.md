# libargon2.cr
A Crystal binding to the Argon2 C library

### Requirements

- libargon2 (compiled and installed by yourself)

### Usage

* Add the following to your `shards.yml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  argon2:
    github: abidon/libargon2.cr
    branch: master
```

* Call the `libargon2` functions

```crystal
require "argon2"

# Create an hasher with specific time cost, memory cost and parallelism level
hasher = Argon2.new 20, 2_u32, 1_u32

# Hash a password with a given salt and hash length
# $argon2i$v=19$m=131072,t=20,p=1$c2FsdHNhbHQ$Y48PG/x+21lkne8mNNKddcIY5X0kLr1CaYjo0toGU6k
hash = hasher.hash_encoded_i("password", "saltsalt", 32_u32)
print hash

# Verifying doesn't require an instance, as all costs are in the encoded hash string
Argon2.verify_i(hash, "password")
```

You can also access the C binding through the `LibArgon2` namespace.
